# Contributing to SMSWithoutborders

Thank you for supporting SMSWithoutBorders. Please follow the steps below to get started. This SMSWithoutBorders.com is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Style Guide

This project was bootstraped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) which specifies environment variable naming conventions.

We use [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management and as such [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview) for data fetching and API Calls.

Files are grouped [by type ](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html) and placed in subfolders under [src](../src). Each subfolder contains an index file for [barrel exports](https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book/blob/master/docs/tips/barrel.md).

## Adding features

Please create a new branch to work on a new feature. That way you can easily roll back if something goes wrong. Once complete open a pull request and we will be happy to review and merge your contribution.

New features are very welcome but should first be discussed with the team for guidance.

New  pages, components and features can be created in their respective folders and linked accordingly. Helper functions can be defined under utils

All routes are defined in App.js and any new routes can be added there.
